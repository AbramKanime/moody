## About Moody

Moody is a mock social media app that allows the user to make posts and share how they are feeling. The purpose for building this project was to learn and practice the use of Firebase for storing and retrieving data. User authentication, real time displays, queries and error handling are all handled in this project.

The app was purely built using Vanilla Javascript, Html, and CSS for styling.
